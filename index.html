                <p>About 1.3 billion tons of food produced for human consumption is either lost or wasted globally. This food is then dumped into landfills, which produces methane (a greenhouse gas) that harms the environment we inhabit. Lastly, food waste is estimated to cost families up to $1,500 annually.</p>
